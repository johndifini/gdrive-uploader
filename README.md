# Gdrive Uploader
Gdrive Uploader is a simple JavaScript to upload a file to Google Drive and set its mimeType.  Why would you ever need to do such a thing?  Well, in my case, I was trying to upload vector graphics via Google Drives browser interface, but it wasn't setting the mimeType correctly.  Therefore, I wasn't able to open the vector graphics with Google Drawings.
